I made this game 6 months after my first programmation course.

This is a very good game if you get all the explanations. Sadly, i used Serializable objects to save the maps easily with java but it does not work if you don’t have the exact same java version than me… 

So you can create your own maps and save them, but you probably won’t have mine, sorry for that.

Launch the game (Fatboy.jar), press the key ‘e’ to go to the map editor, and start to create a map (without knowing the game, i know…). You can watch a small demo version to help you.

The keys are the arrows.

You can change level using ‘a’ or ‘z’ (previous and next level), go to the editor with ‘e’, pause the game with ‘p’ and delete a map by pressing together ‘q’,’c’,’h’,’o’ while on the map.
