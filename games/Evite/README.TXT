This is my second java game, made 4 month after my first programming course. The implementation of some functionalities are bad, but the game is still fun.

The keys are q,z,d,s and the arrows are the move keys for the 2 players.

Notice that you can push the other by moving away from him while close to him.

Double click on “Evite.jar” to launch the game.

Have fun !
