This is a great game, but i didn't understand all the network subtleties when i developed it.
So it woks well when you play locally (server and client on the same computer) but it gets
incoherent if you do it from different computers. This is bad for the gameplay right?

The game starts only when you have 2 sessions of the game connected together. The first one
needs to host, and the other needs to join the ip address of the server (written on top).
The goal is to dominate the galaxy, get ressources, build unit factories, create ships and fight.

You can get new ships by building the lab, you get magic power if you create the magic tower.
The mines gives you ressources.
Be careful, you can build them only once, so defend that planet or the ennemi will destroy it and probably win.

The building system is weird, you need to get all the ressources out of the square in order
to be able to build something, the units that collect the ressources are in the bottom of the planet.
They keep the ressources with them and they need to be on the right planet in order to buy new units with these ressources.
The magic powers uses the global ressources.
You can create portals (magic tower required) and attack from the other side of the galaxy.
You can heal or dommage units with the spells.
...

You can create a new world with the editor, chose the planets, ressources and units.
There is also a mirror mode for the planet creation...

There are 2 spaceGame.jar because you cannot launch again the first one if you want to simulate the game.
